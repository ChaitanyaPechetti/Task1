                Robert Downey Jr. (RDJ) is an American actor and producer best known for portraying Tony Stark/Iron Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). His career is a story of redemption, going from early success to struggles with substance abuse and then making one of the greatest comebacks in Hollywood history.
                Robert was born into a film family—his father, Robert Downey Sr., was an actor and filmmaker. He started acting at a young age, making his film debut at just five years old in his father’s movie Pound (1970).Anthony Edward Stark, or Tony Stark, is a fictional character primarily portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise —based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name— commonly known by his alias, Iron Man. Stark is initially depicted as an industrialist, genius inventor, and former playboy who is CEO of Stark Industries. Initially the chief weapons manufacturer for the U.S. military, he has a change of heart and redirects his technical knowledge into creating mechanized suits of armor, which he uses to defend Earth.

                Stark becomes a founding member and eventual leader of the Avengers. Following his failed Ultron Program, the internal conflict within the Avengers due to the Sokovia Accords, and Thanos successfully erasing half of all life in the Blip, Stark retires, marries Pepper Potts, and they have a daughter named Morgan. However, Stark rejoins the Avengers on a final mission to undo Thanos' actions. He engineers a time travel device, and the Avengers successfully restore trillions of lives across the universe before Stark ultimately sacrifices his life to defeat Thanos and his army. Stark chooses Peter Parker as a successor.
                
                Stark is one of the central figures of the MCU, having appeared in nine films as of 2024. The character and Downey's performance have been credited with helping to cement the MCU as a multi-billion-dollar franchise, with Stark's evolution often considered the defining arc of the series.
